                </p><p><strong>Tell us more about yourself&nbsp;</strong><br>I tend to wander around in a new city and then get lost.&nbsp;After repeating that for a couple of days, a mental map forms: Paris, New York, Seoul, DC. While visiting family&nbsp;in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, on block 3 of my wandering from my grandpa's store and home, I&nbsp;wandered into a ceramic store, fell for a piece, and&nbsp;cradle&nbsp;the pot back home to Florida. Ever since, there was&nbsp;this&nbsp;lingering question of whether if I could reproduce something as fine.<br><br><b>Inspirations and ideas</b><span>&nbsp;</span><br>Much of my form and skills come from the studios and people in them. I throw at a number of places, and each has its own regulars and culture, and from that, I learn and get inspired. It's one thing to look at images on the web and another to hold someone's&nbsp;work&nbsp;in your hand and to run your fingers up its wall or to examine and talk about glazes after a firing. I really am fortunate to have met so many great&nbsp;artists and to work in so many spaces.<br><br><b>Advice for new comer<span>&nbsp;</span></b><br>While in Ojai, Ca., I met this woman who owned a bookstore in town, and my friend and I were pestering and peppering her with questions of how she started the bookstore and all. She kept on saying we had to “pay our dues” in life in order to have great things. And this is very much applicable to ceramics as well. Make the mistakes and learn from them, put the hours to get the moves down, and see glazing as an art and science. Above all, don't forget: "pay your dues!"</p>
                <p><strong>Process&nbsp;<br></strong>I'm a believer of the Japanese philosophy of Kaizan, the idea of incremental improvements compared to big leaps. Every week, I have a piece that I'm refining and reiterating. After twenty or so attempts, then am I satisfied.&nbsp;When I was working on cups at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.potterycoast.com/" target="_blank" title="Pottery Coast" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pottery Coast</a>, it took me over a month to get the form just right. At the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.asi.calpoly.edu/university_union/craft_center" target="_blank" title="Cal Poly Art Center" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cal Poly Craft Center,</a><span>&nbsp;</span>my bigger Hawaiian red planters&nbsp;stood out among the smaller white clay pieces on the greenware and bisque shelves. That, too, took me over a month to figure out, the right weight and shape. Often, with many of the beta pieces, I quietly sneak them into the trash bin&nbsp;or keep it in my&nbsp;mistake&nbsp;pile. From my time in education, I learned&nbsp;the&nbsp;importance of&nbsp;reviewing&nbsp;and reflecting, hence&nbsp;my mistake pile.&nbsp;</p>
