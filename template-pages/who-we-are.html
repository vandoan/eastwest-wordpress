          EastWest Collective is a small group of moonlighting makers based in San Luis Obispo. 
          We began the collective to strengthen the maker community here in the Central Coast and believe in the importance of giving back, donating a portion of our sales to local nonprofits. 
          <br><br>Join us as we travel around California <br>sharing the joy that handmade objects bring to our lives.

                        I’m originally from Virginia but spent the last ten years bouncing around the South and Midwest. Now, finally making out West I’m living on the Central Coast of California. I spent the better part of my life devoted to learning and working as an artist/designer.

                        Prior to the Central Coast life, he lived in Brooklyn and worked at a publishing house in Manhattan. After another brutal winter, he shipped several boxes to the West, packed his Suby to the gills,
                        and spent 4 months zig-zagging across the U.S. and British Columbia, from one climbing
                        destination to another, meeting old friends and making new ones. 
                        <br>
                        <br>If he's not in one of the area's ceramic studios, then most likely he can be found at the climbing gym or
                        on a rock somewhere with friends.
